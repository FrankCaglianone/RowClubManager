# RowClubManager ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-00599C?style=flat-square&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white)

`RowClubManager` is a set of C++ structures and functions designed to manage boats and excursions at a rowing club. The club has a number of boats and a number of members who join the club to participate in excursions. Each excursion must be recorded, so that the system can keep track of which boats are in use at any given time. The system also keeps track of the number of excursions and the total number of kilometers traveled by each member of the club. 


## Project Purpose 🎯
This software was developed as part of the Systems Programming course at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), Lugano, taught by Professor Dr. [Antonio Carzaniga](https://search.usi.ch/it/persone/cdc278cad8619ae5f51219135ee1599d/carzaniga-antonio).

## Requirements 📋
- C/C++ compiler

## Project Structure 🏗️
- `create_club()`: Initializes a new, empty club. Returns a pointer or `nullptr` on failure.
- `destroy_club(c)`: Destroys the specified club, freeing all resources.
- `add_boat(c, name, max_crew)`: Adds a boat to the club. Returns `1` on success; `0` on failure or if the boat name already exists.
- `add_person(c, name)`: Adds a person to the club. Returns `1` on success; `0` if the name already exists.
- `create_excursion(c)`: Prepares a new excursion. Returns a pointer or `nullptr` on failure.
- `use_boat(e, name)`: Assigns a boat to an excursion. Returns `1` on success; `0` otherwise.
- `add_crew(e, name)`: Adds a crew member to an excursion. Returns `1` on success; `0` if conditions fail.
- `close_excursion(e, k)`: Ends an excursion, recording the distance traveled. Returns `1` on success; `0` if setup is incomplete.
- `cancel_excursion(e)`: Cancels an excursion and frees resources.
- `get_crew_excursions(c, name)`: Returns the number of excursions by a member. Returns `-1` on error.
- `get_crew_kilometers(c, name)`: Returns the total kilometers traveled by a member. Returns `-1` on error.
- `boat_available(c, name)`: Checks boat availability. Returns `1` if available; `0` or `-1` on error.
- `get_boat_excursions(c, name)`: Returns the number of excursions using a specific boat. Returns `-1` on error.
- `get_boat_kilometers(c, name)`: Returns the distance traveled by a specific boat. Returns `-1` on error.

## Usage 🛠️
The application includes a Makefile for easy compilation and testing. Ensure that the `test` folder, `Makefile`, the header file named `rowing.h`, and the source code file named `rowing.cc` are all in the same directory. Follow the steps below to compile and test the software:

### Running Tests
To compile and run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
make rowing
```
### Creating an Executable
If you wish to perform custom operations, insert the desired operations into the main function of rowing.cc. Compile the program into an executable named main with the following command:
```bash
g++ -g rowing.cc -o main
```
This will allow you to execute your custom operations by running ./main.
